              <p class="text-left">Backup refers to the copying of physical or virtual files or databases to a
                secondary location for
                preservation in case of equipment failure or catastrophe. The process of backing up data is pivotal
                to a successful disaster recovery plan (DRP).Backup and recovery testing examines an organization's
                practices and technologies for data security and data replication. The goal is to ensure rapid and
                reliable data retrieval should the need arise. The process of retrieving backed-up data files is known
                as file restoration.The terms data backup and data protection are often used interchangeably, although
                data protection encompasses the broader goals of business continuity (BC), data security, information
                lifecycle management and prevention of malware and computer viruses.</p>

                You specify the
                source, process the fields making any required transformation, and set the destination entity and
                bundle. The following code snippet shows the source, process, and destination sections. Configuration
                placed in a module’s config/install directory will be copied to Drupal’s active configuration.
                And if those files have a dependencies/enforced/module key, the configuration will be removed when
                the listed modules are uninstalled. That is how the content type, the paragraph type, and the fields
                are automatically created and deleted.The node migration will serve as the host for both referenced
                entities: images and paragraphs. The image migration is very similar to the one explained in a previous
                article. This time, the focus will be the paragraph migration.</p>

                Disadvantages of High Speed Data Transmission Technology Over Dial-Up.
                DSL Distance Limitation: Currently, Verizon Online DSL is only available to customers residing
                within 3 “wire-run” miles (up to 18,000 feet) from their Verizon Central Office. In addition,
                customers must be served over copper wires which may limit the availability of DSL
                The cost of construction of fiber optic networks.
                Once Verizon’s FiOS service using fiber optic cable has been installed, service migration

                Mobile internet in Pakistan used to be painfully slow. Up to 2014 only 2G with EDGE was available.
                Internet cafes have been often equally slow and not widely available outside tourist locations. In April
                2014 frequencies for 3G and 4G were auctioned. Since then the mobile operators are quickly building up
                high speed networks throughout the country. Mobilink and Telenor are already covering some hundred
                cities
                with 3G, while Zong and Warid concentrate on 4G/LTE in major towns only.
                Coverage on the countryside and in the mountainous areas in the north, where many visitors are
                likely to travel, is still poor. Sometimes when there's no signal, villagers will know of a
                "mobile point", a specific spot nearby that happens to have a signal from one or more networks.
                That's why many Pakistanis carry SIMs from more than one network.
                Things have improved since as 4G/LTE is accessible by about half the population at an average
                speed of 12 Mbit/s according to OpenSignal in 2017.

                Mobilink and Warid agreed to a merger that has been finalized in 2016. This is completed by
                Q2/2017 and a new market leader called Jazz was created.
                The PTCL (Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd.) is the former state-owned and now
                semi-privatised incumbent provider. In 2018 they have upgraded their fixed-wireless
                TD-LTE network, marketed by as "CharJi 4G LTE" in Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar.
                They use the 1900 MHz frequency for TD-LTE on band 35 and 36. As part of the development,
                its legacy ‘3G EVO’ service, which uses CDMA and EVDO technology is switched off.
